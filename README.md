# sbom2notice

Local-first tool for developers and compliance managers to **convert SBOMs (SPDX / CycloneDX)** into structured `NOTICE` files.

- Runs entirely **in your browser** â€” no uploads, no servers.
- **GDPR-friendly by design** (suitable for EU/DE companies).
- Drag & drop your SBOM JSON, validate it, and generate a NOTICE skeleton.
- Edit gaps via a built-in **Form Builder** with progress tracking.
- Save drafts locally, reopen anytime, download final NOTICE.
